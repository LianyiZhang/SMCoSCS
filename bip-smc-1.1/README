First, you need to correctly setup BIP v1 to be able to compile and run examples.
see http://www-verimag.imag.fr/New-BIP-tools.html?lang=en for details

Launche the BIP-SMC Tool:
cd ~/path/to/bip-smc/tool
bouble click on the tool jar to run the GUI

You can try the tool with the examples below or your own

BIP1 example:
	PTP model: examples/PTP
	You need to first compile the BIP sources to produce an executable (use the build.sh script)
	Example Properties: 
	P>=0.25[G{1000}(abs(Master.tm-Slave.ts)<=50)]
	P=?[G{1000}(abs(Master.tm-Slave.ts)<=50)]
